## Motivation
* Understand the construction of REST APIs
* Study and Implement microservice architecture 
* Study HTTP performance tools that exist - including some that are cloud based, and some non-cloud based.

* Develop a REST front-end to the databases to execute scripts that run the TPC benchmark setup
* Develop a REST front-end to fire some of the main queries
* Measure the response times of the queries
* Study the construction of important Web benchmarks like YCSB, and 1-2 HTTP testing tools like K6/JMeter/Vegata/Goad
